ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @finestrax

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code and exploring the world of software development. My main focus is on JavaScript and Python, but I'm also interested in other programming languages and technologies.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of JavaScript and Python, including variables, data types, functions, and control structures. I'm also learning how to use Git and GitHub to manage my code and collaborate with others.

ðŸ’ž Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects and learn from experienced developers. I'm excited to contribute to projects that align with my interests and help me grow as a developer.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me through my GitHub profile or by DM. I'm always open to connecting with other developers and learning from their experiences.
